# Intro content
st.write("""
In the realm of squash, where every swing, smash, and slide counts, it's often the banter that lingers longer than the actual scores. But why rely solely on memory and wit? Memories fade, your digital footprints won't. Back your pre- and postgame trashtalk with serious, objective performance statistics.

Document each exhilarating (or ego-crushing) match result. Rest easy â€” entries are encrypted in our database. Remember, you'll need your seed later to relive (or regret) those game stats.

st.write("""
Step into our digital hall of fame (and occasional shame). Each match you play, every score you chalk up, is more than just a numberâ€”it's a testament to skill, strategy, and that sneaky drop shot you've been perfecting. Whether it's an earth-shattering victory or a humble hiccup, it'll be archived here in all its glory.

Whether it's an insight from last week's match or a curiosity about your overall performance against left-handed players, the bot's got your back.
